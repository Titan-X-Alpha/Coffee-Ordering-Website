        <h1>About Starbucks</h1>
        <p>
            Starbucks is a global coffeehouse chain that has revolutionized the way people enjoy coffee. Founded in 1971 in Seattle, Washington, Starbucks has grown from a single store selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment to a multinational company with over 32,000 locations worldwide. Known for its signature green logo and warm ambiance, Starbucks is more than just a coffeehouse—it's a community hub where people come to relax, connect, and enjoy a variety of handcrafted beverages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Starbucks experience is defined by its commitment to quality, sustainability, and innovation. The company sources coffee beans from ethical and sustainable farms around the world, ensuring not only premium quality but also environmental responsibility. Starbucks has implemented various initiatives, including fair trade certification and the Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices, to support farmers and promote sustainable coffee production.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coffee, Starbucks has become synonymous with a culture of inclusivity and connection. The company fosters a welcoming environment for all customers, encouraging them to make Starbucks their “third place” between home and work. The menu has evolved over the years to include a diverse range of options, from classic espresso beverages to teas, smoothies, and seasonal favorites. Moreover, Starbucks caters to health-conscious customers with dairy-free and plant-based options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Innovation is at the heart of Starbucks' success. The company continually adapts to customer preferences, introducing mobile ordering, drive-thru services, and the Starbucks Rewards program, which allows loyal customers to earn points and enjoy personalized offers. Starbucks has also embraced the digital age by expanding its presence on social media and creating an engaging online community.
        </p>
